### Retrospective/General Observations
#### 13OCT15
Morale is high, we came in with LTC Burrow and discussed the broad picture of what Black Knight II needs to accomplish---everything from launch to normalized operations.
We all know very little about what anything actually is, but we're ready to learn.

Failed PDR briefing today.

Today we reviewed the LA Hacks team's sprint 2 review, which LTC Burrow said was a very good example of what a sprint review should look like.
We feel confident that the sprint review for sprint 3 will reflect the work done for this sprint, which was almost entirely PDR work.
I wish I could have been able to do more work to get the flight computer operational.
